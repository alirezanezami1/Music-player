# Music-player

development a music player with HTML, CSS, Javascript

### details :
- For this project, I wrote an animation to show the cover music so that it is not simple and monotonous :
```css
  from {transform: rotate(0deg);}
    to {transform: rotate(360deg);}
```

I prepared a list for music to make it easier for the user to choose music, which you can see in the [demo link](https://alirezanezami1.github.io/Music-player/)
